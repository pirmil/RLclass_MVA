    "## Three intrinsic challenges in Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we can identify three challenges which make the RL problem intrinsically difficult:\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Intrinsic challenges in RL:**  \n",
    "- function approximation,\n",
    "- the improvement problem,\n",
    "- the exploration versus exploitation trade-off.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "These three challenges are quite independent and we could study them in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, **function approximation** is key in finding good policies. Although it needs not be tackled with stochastic gradient descent, the interplay between Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning has triggered major advances in RL. \n",
    "Chapter 4 is dedicated to this topic and will lead us to manipulate function approximators in AVI, including deep neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas we developped in this class relied on estimating value functions to deduce greedy policies. Finding such greedy policies was made easy because actions were discrete. But **finding improving policies** is actually a challenge in itself. This problem is present both when one searches for a greedy action with respect to $Q$, and when one directly aims at solving the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem without going through the proxy of the optimality equation. Chapter 5 will take us towards the realm of continuous actions in AVI. Chapter 6 will tackle direct policy search and resolution of the $\\max_\\pi J(\\pi)$ problem, notably through policy gradient algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior policies are a cornerstone of RL: which action should one take to obtain informative samples? Should one explore uniformly the environment or rather follow a policy that takes the system towards promising states before exploring more agressively? This is called the **tradeoff between exploration and exploitation**. The last two sessions of the class will be dedicated to properly studying this tradeoff through stochastic bandits, which leads to the UCT and Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithms that are at the root of [alphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Subtopics in RL\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond these three intrinsic challenges, there are countless, context-dependent, open questions in RL, that form a span of specific questions:\n",
    "- Hierarchical RL\n",
    "- RL from human feedback\n",
    "- World (surrogate) models\n",
    "- Multi-agent RL\n",
    "- Partially observable MDPs\n",
    "- Robust RL\n",
    "- Offline RL\n",

But there is a catch, the number of these resulting features grows exponentially with $k$ and so does the dimension of the value function's search space $span(\\varphi)$: that is the **curse of dimensionality** that makes searching for a value function exponentially more difficult as the state space dimension grows.\n",

    "<li><b>SARSA($\\lambda$)</b><br>\n",
    "SARSA is an on-policy method and we've seen that so is TD($\\lambda$) so it seems rather straightforward to implement a SARSA($\\lambda$) algorithm that, hopefully, will have better convergence properties than plain SARSA.\n",

    "This time it is not as straightfoward to derive a $Q(\\lambda)$ algorithm from TD($\\lambda$), precisely because TD($\\lambda$) evaluates the policy being applied and not another one. Can you imagine a way to still perform $Q(\\lambda)$ updates? An answer is found in Watkins's thesis that introduces Q-learning in 1989. For a more recent approach and other references, see Sutton et al, <b>A new Q($\\lambda$) with interim forward view and Monte Carlo equivalence</b>, 2014)\n",
